# Image Classifier: Dog Breed Identification

## Overview

This project aims to develop an image classification system to identify dog breeds using deep learning models. The classifier leverages pre-trained models from the PyTorch library, including ResNet18, AlexNet, and VGG16, to achieve accurate breed identification from images.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dog-breed-classifier.git
cd dog-breed-classifier
```

## Usage

### Running the Classifier

To run the image classifier, execute the following command:

```bash
python check_images.py --dir <directory_with_images> --arch <model_name> --dogfile <dogfile.txt>
```

- `--dir`: Directory containing images to classify.
- `--arch`: Model architecture to use (`resnet18`, `alexnet`, `vgg16`).
- `--dogfile`: Text file containing the list of dog breeds.

### Example

```bash
python check_images.py --dir pet_images --arch vgg16 --dogfile dognames.txt
```

### Understanding the Output

The classifier will output the classification results, including statistics such as the number of correctly classified dog images, breed matches, and overall accuracy.

## Models

This project uses the following pre-trained models from the PyTorch library:

- **ResNet18**: A residual neural network with 18 layers.
- **AlexNet**: A convolutional neural network known for its role in popularizing deep learning.
- **VGG16**: A deep convolutional neural network with 16 layers.

### Switching Models

You can switch between different models by specifying the `--arch` argument when running the classifier. For instance, to use ResNet18, set `--arch resnet18`.

## Results

The `calculates_results_stats.py` script computes various statistics from the classification results, such as:

- Number of images
- Number of dog images
- Number of non-dog images
- Number of matches between pet and classifier labels
- Number of correctly classified dogs and breeds
- Percentage accuracy for matches, dogs, breeds, and non-dogs
